## About Me
I am Pedro Nakamura, Gameplay Programmer.

I mostly use Unity + Visual Studio (C#), but am able to handle C++ & Java.
Enroled in College at PUC-SP (Sao Paulo, Brazil) until Dec/2024.

Currently a generalist, but I really enjoy more developing UI and Player/Controls behaviour.
Learning more about multiplayer / networking. (as of Jun/2024)

Highly Interested in Game Design, this help me develop modular tools that can be changed easily by designers without needing more code
